# HelloWorld

This is my first project with Angular and decided to start by getting a "Hello World" up and running.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.21.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
